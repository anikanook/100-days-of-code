# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on Codecademy tutorials on JavaScript and PHP that have been languishing on my to-do list for ages.

**Thoughts:** Excited to finally tackle some things on my to-do list.  Wish I had started this a week or more ago since I have actually been on a coding streak for since then.  Oh well.  Time to "get credit" for it, so to speak.  

### Day 2: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Codecademy tutorials on JavaScript and PHP.

**Thoughts:** I feel a bit fuzzy brained and not too excited about what I did today, though I did do a lot.  I read a couple of articles and listened to a TED talk on computational thinking.  I'm really into learning the foundational theory of programming right now.  I'll probably finish the last few exercises in the Programming Foundations: Fundamentals course (taught by Simon Allardice on Lynda.com) tonight.  That course has really propelled me forward toward stronger JavaScript and PHP skills.  But I'm stuck on a do-while loop that Codecademy is accepting as correct, but not running. Argh!   

### Day 3: May 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: PHP loops and functions.

**Thoughts:** Looking ahead to the holiday weekend and strategizing how I can get some small wins and still code every day.  I'm thinking a tribute page on codepen and copying some codepens that I like.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
